# AES-RSA
Implementation shows the AES encryption and RSA for digital signature for communication between client and server
Make sure all files are in same folder , main file are server.py which act as server waiting for client to connect , so its the first file to be run, then client.py you have to run , and all the other files are common like AES RSA you can use them seperately if you want to .
